## Consensus and Negotiation Rules

### Consensus Detection

- When one agent genuinely concedes to the other's position
- When mutual understanding is achieved despite remaining differences

### Consensus Signals
- Explicit agreement statements: "I agree with your conclusion"
- Acknowledgment of the strength of opponent's arguments
- Convergence on key factual points
- Mutual concession and compromise

### Negotiation Guidelines
- Focus on finding common ground
- Identify areas of agreement before addressing differences
- Be willing to modify positions based on evidence
- Seek win-win solutions rather than zero-sum outcomes

### End Conditions
- Explicit consensus reached by both parties
- Fundamental disagreement acknowledged but respectfully maintained
- Time/round limits reached with summary of positions
- External intervention (user commands)
